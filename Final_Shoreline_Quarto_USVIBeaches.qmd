## Introduction

This study focuses on documenting short-term beach erosion and recovery at Lindbergh Bay and Lindquist Beach on St. Thomas through ongoing, consistent monitoring efforts. By conducting repeated topographic and nearshore bathymetric surveys over the course of a year, we capture seasonal and event-scale changes in beach morphology and establish baseline information for both sites. Currently, no consistent short-term baseline data exist for sandy beaches in the U.S. Virgin Islands, making it difficult to understand how these systems naturally vary or respond to storm events.

Lindbergh Bay is of particular interest as it contains a large, artificial excavated hole left from past dredging activities (Fig. 1). This feature creates an abrupt deep nearshore basin that may alter wave transformation and sediment transport. In contrast, Lindquist Beach is exposed primarily to Atlantic swell and lacks major anthropogenic alterations, making it a useful comparative site. Because it experiences a different wave climate, and does not contain features like the excavation hole, Lindquist functions as a natural reference site for evaluating how a relatively undisturbed system behaves under seasonal and event-scale forcing. Comparing these two beaches allows us to isolate the influence of wave exposure and bathymetry on sediment dynamics and recovery patterns.

Another key component of this work is assessing whether the type of benthic habitat (e.g., seagrass beds) plays a role in sediment retention, shoreline behavior, or recovery rates following erosive conditions. By filling this data gap, this project provides context for future monitoring, modeling, and coastal management in the USVI.

## Research Methodologies

We have collected data on beach response to various wave conditions at Lindbergh Bay and Lindquist Beach on St. Thomas, USVI. Both of these beaches are fronted by bare sand, with regions of seagrass beds existing in the nearshore environment. We use GNSS receivers (Spectra base and rover) paired to a mobile echosounder sonar system, to collect high-accuracy positional, elevation, and depth data along predefined transects perpendicular to the shoreline (Figs. 2 & 3).

We also conduct drone surveys equipped with a high-resolution camera and RTK positioning to monitor topographic elevation changes in these beach environments (Fig. 4).

Additionally, we map benthic habitats at each study site and link these habitat maps to observed spatial patterns in beach and nearshore elevation changes. To analyze these changes in a hydrodynamic context, we also measure offshore and nearshore wave conditions and incorporate them into XBeach simulations to model morphological change and evaluate model performance.

## Results

**Erosion Index**

We derived the erosion index (I) from model outputs to quantify sediment transport across habitat types (Fig. 5).

Under high-energy wave conditions, the modeled hydrodynamics consistently show that vegetated profiles (seagrass) reduce nearshore wave energy/setup and associated erosion potential compared to unvegetated sand or revetment profiles. In the wave height evolution plot, waves shoal similarly offshore, but the sandy/revetment profile exhibits wave breaking closer to shore and maintains larger post-breaking heights than the seagrass profile. This aligns with the higher wave setup calculated for sand (0.243 m vs. 0.225 m over seagrass), reflecting greater momentum flux and a larger increase in nearshore water level. The undertow plot supports this pattern, as peak offshore-directed currents remain higher over sand in the nearshore environment, indicating more intense return-flow associated with higher wave breaking and sediment mobilization. Correspondingly, the erosion index is greater over sand (270 W m⁻² vs. 240 W m⁻²), consistent with the higher hydrodynamic forcing.

**Wave Forcing**

Seagrass bed morphology consistently reduced erosion potential across most wave conditions examined. Wave setup decreased over the seagrass beds up to a threshold wave energy, beyond which the effect was reduced.

## Conclusion and future steps

These results demonstrate that while seagrass can significantly reduce erosion under moderate wave conditions, its protective influence can diminish during extreme events, limiting its effectiveness when it may be needed most. Our next steps include collecting data on seagrass parameters to run into more advanced models (e.g., SWAN) to compute for other factors (e.g., swash) influencing erosion between small and large waves.
